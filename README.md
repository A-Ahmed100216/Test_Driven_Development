# TDD - Test Driven Development

## Contents
* **TDD**

# Why TDD?
* Before we can release any product or software, we must test it t ensure it if fit for purpose.
* Unit Testing - Testing an individual component of a whole product.
* Product Testing - Testing a fully assembled product.
* Good unit testing is important for whole product testing. If each aspect works well separately, we know the issues occurred in assembly, rather than testing each separate component after.
* TDD helps us minimise the risk of failure after sending the product to production.
## Steps
1. Create a file to write tests
2. Run the test file, the tests should all fail.
3. Create a file to write code 
4. Refactor and add the code to pass the tests.



# TDD in Python
Python has several modules that we can use to test our code including:
* pytest
* unittest
