# Why test?
* Before we can release any product or software, we must test it t ensure it if fit for purpose.
* Unit Testing - Testing an individual component of a whole product.
* Product Testing - Testing a fully assembled product.
* Good unit testing is important for whole product testing. If each aspect works well separately, we know the issues occurred in assembly, rather than testing each seperate component after.
